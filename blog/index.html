            <h2>Hello, World</h2>
            <p>My name is Miranda Loughry. I’m a student, a dancer, a writer, and an amateur programmer. Also, I’m legally blind.</p>
            <p>I can remember struggling to see clearly when I was in first or second grade. I knew I couldn’t function in the same way as my classmates, but I was afraid to ask anyone for help. A few years later, just after my tenth birthday, my parents took me to an optometrist when I couldn’t pass a simple vision test my pediatrician administered. After running copious diagnostic tests, the optometrist referred me to a specialist, and the specialist told me that I have Stargardt disease.
            </p>
            <p>At first, I was confused. I didn’t know what would happen next, and I was afraid of the future. How quickly would my vision degenerate? Would I be able to operate without the full use of my eyes? How could I navigate a world built for sighted people? I didn’t have all the answers then, but I’m figuring them out as I go along, solving each problem as it confronts me. And you know what? That's okay. Everyone else is, too.

        <div class="post">
            <h2>So, What's Stargardt?</h2>
            <p>Stargardt is an hereditary, autosomal recessive form of macular degeneration, most commonly caused by a mutation in the ABCA4 gene. If you’re not a geneticist, suffice it to say that it’s the most common form of juvenile MD, affecting about 1 in every 10,000 people. Most people are diagnosed when they’re fairly young, but delayed diagnosis is actually a big problem because many of the symptoms (e.g. Loss of visual acuity, photophobia, etc.) can be mistaken for more garden-variety vision problems.
            </p>
            <p>Primarily, Stargardt affects visual acuity. Central vision progressively degenerates in a cycle of sharp declines followed by long, stable plateaus. Other symptoms vary wildly between cases: some people are intensely light-sensitive (as am I), while other people experience loss of color vision, flashes of light, and all manner of other visual phenomenon. It almost inevitable that vision will eventually decline to the point of legal blindness (20/200 acuity or worse), so most people try to preserve their remaining vision by wearing UV protective sunglasses or taking vitamin supplements.
            </p>
            <p>It’s not all bad, though. I find adaptive equipment like CCTVs and screen readers to be extraordinarily useful, and though some people may need navigational aids (guide dogs or canes), many people can function perfectly well without them. There are many promising <a href="http://www.blindness.org/blog/index.php/category/diseases/stargardt/" target="_blank">clinical trials</a> for gene therapy, and some researchers are even working on adapting <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/538491/augmented-reality-glasses-could-help-legally-blind-navigate/" target="_blank">augmented reality</a> technology to help visually impaired people. </p>

            <h2>How Stargardt Affects Eyes</h2>
            <p>Proteins are not just tasty things found in steaks and energy bars; they’re actually one of the fundamental macromolecules found in living organisms. Proteins can do all sorts of useful things, from carrying messages, ferrying molecules back and forth, catalyzing metabolic reactions, replicating DNA, and many other functions.</p>
            <p> Stargardt is caused by a mutation that disables the portion that clears out the lipid byproducts of cells in the retina. Without this protein, fatty deposits build up on the macula (the centermost portion of the retina), and photoreceptor cells are starved of nutrients. When the photoreceptor cells die, they can’t send electrical signals for the brain to interpret as visual images.
            </p>
            <p>So, basically, mutated gene &rarr; malfunctioning protein &rarr; fatty deposits on retina &rarr; dying photoreceptor cells &rarr; blind spot.
